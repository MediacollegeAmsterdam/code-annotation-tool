## Why

The code annotation tool needs comprehensive testing coverage and user validation from its target audience: Dutch-speaking students learning to code and teachers creating educational presentations. A Dutch-language test plan and user question lists will enable systematic feature validation while gathering actionable feedback from real users in their native language.

## What Changes

- Create a comprehensive yet simple test plan in Dutch covering all core features
- Develop student-focused question list to evaluate learning and usability
- Develop teacher-focused question list to evaluate presentation workflow effectiveness
- Ensure all testable factors are covered systematically

## Capabilities
